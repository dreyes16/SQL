I created my own clothing store where  at least 5 columns for the kind of data were listed. I also, seleceted the item  where i at least sold 15 pieces, and listed in descending order. 
CREATE TABLE clothes (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, price INTEGER, quantity INTEGER, sold INTEGER);

CREATE TABLE clothes (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, price INTEGER, quantity INTEGER, sold INTEGER, color TEXT);


INSERT INTO clothes VALUES (1, "Skirts", 25, 30, 15, "black");
INSERT INTO clothes VALUES (2, "Shirts", 15, 30, 20, "green");
INSERT INTO clothes VALUES (3, "Pants", 40, 30, 15, "black");
INSERT INTO clothes VALUES (4, "Shorts", 10, 30, 20, "white");
INSERT INTO clothes VALUES (5, "Socks", 5, 30, 25, "black");

SELECT * FROM clothes WHERE sold >= 15 
ORDER BY price desc;
